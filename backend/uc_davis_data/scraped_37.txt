Center for Educational Effectiveness
Who we are
The
Center for Educational Effectiveness
(CEE) partners with instructors and teaching assistants to
design, refine, and sustain effective learning environments
that are
evidence-based, inclusive, and student-centered
. More than a service unit, we aim to build a
reflective, collaborative community of educator-leaders
who continuously
iterate, experiment, and expand inclusive teaching practices campus-wide
. We accomplish this through
learning analytics, tailored consultations, timely workshops, robust resources, and instructional innovations
to help foster deeper learning and stronger student success.
Schedule a consultation
CEE offers a variety of consultation types to provide you with feedback on your teaching, strategies to achieve your teaching goals, and instructional resources to inform your teaching practice. Consultations are available to all instructors.
Attend a workshop
CEE hosts an array of workshops for both faculty and graduate students. These workshops give participants an opportunity to learn about evidence-based teaching strategies and identify practical applications for their particular teaching context.
Engage in assessment
By working together, we foster a culture of curiosity about student learning by building capacity for sustainable outcomes assessment practices which improve student learning and support evidence-informed decision-making. Come get curious with us!
